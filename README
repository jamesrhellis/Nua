Nua - Not lUA

A simple implimentation of a Lua-like programming language.
Currently needs some work to be usable as a stable programming language:
- Automated method of triggering the GC
- Stable C api
- Embedding support
- Standard library

Differences to Lua:
- 0 indexing
- no co-routines
- no weak references
- functions do not have up-values or global tables, but meta-tables instead,
	this would allow for manipulation within the language,
	but is less efficient
- no meta-table functions (yet)
